### **Step-by-Step Instructions**

#### **1. Prepare the Dough**
1. In a bowl, dissolve the sugar in the warm water and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes, or until the mixture becomes foamy. This step activates the yeast.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.
3. Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Mix until a shaggy dough forms.
4. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for about 8–10 minutes, or until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. Alternatively, use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook for kneading.
5. Place the kneaded dough in a greased bowl and cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap. Let it rise for 1–1.5 hours in a warm spot until it doubles in size.

#### **2. Prepare the Pizza Sauce**
1. In a small saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat and sauté the minced garlic until fragrant (about 30 seconds).
2. Add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer on low heat for 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens.
3. Taste and adjust seasoning. Let it cool before using.

#### **3. Shape the Dough**
1. Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats.
2. Punch down the risen dough to release air. Divide it into 2 equal portions for two 12-inch pizzas or leave it whole for one large pizza.
3. On a floured surface, stretch or roll out the dough to your desired thickness. If you like a thicker, chewier crust, keep it thicker. For a crispy crust, roll it thin.
4. Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel dusted with cornmeal, or directly onto a baking sheet or pizza stone.

#### **4. Assemble the Pizza**
1. Spread a thin layer of prepared pizza sauce evenly across the dough, leaving a border for the crust.
2. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.
3. Add your chosen toppings: pepperoni, cooked sausage, vegetables, or anything you like.
4. Optionally, drizzle a little olive oil over the top for extra flavor.

#### **5. Bake the Pizza**
1. Place the pizza in the preheated oven. If using a pizza stone, slide the pizza onto the hot stone using your peel.
2. Bake for 8–12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling and slightly browned.
3. Keep an eye on the pizza as baking times may vary depending on your oven and the thickness of your crust.

#### **6. Serve and Enjoy**
1. Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for 1–2 minutes before slicing.
2. Garnish with fresh basil, grated Parmesan, or red pepper flakes as desired.
3. Slice and serve!

### Tips for Success:
1. **Preheat Properly**: A hot oven is essential for a crispy crust. Preheat for at least 20–30 minutes before baking.
2. **Use a Pizza Stone**: A pizza stone helps mimic a pizzeria-style oven by evenly distributing heat.
3. **Experiment with Toppings**: Be creative—try exotic toppings like arugula, goat cheese, or BBQ chicken.
4. **Make Dough Ahead**: Pizza dough can be made ahead of time and stored in the fridge for up to 3 days.
